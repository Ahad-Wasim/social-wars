		Teh Playgound is a PHP testbed, where you can do rapid PHP prototyping without the need to build your own LAMP stack or bother with saving files and the like.
It allows you to slap together a quick block of code and render it straight in your browser, and even proceed to send that data over to a friend or colleague for collaboration.

Usage

Just type your PHP code in the left hand side there, and when you're ready to run it, just hit CTRL+Enter - that's it. It'll render and the output will be shown over here, errors and all. 
Your code is saved on the server, so you can keep the URL handy and come back to it at a later point, or even send it off to a friend for them to check it out and run it as well.
It does need Javascript enabled to run, since it does AJAX stuff, and does not fail gracefully if it's missing, so wah-wah to you if you don't like that.
We've even started you off with some example code to the left - hit CTRL+Enter to see it run!

Haxors

The only thing we ask is that you try not to break it.
This is provided free of charge to the public, and attacks or misuse will only get it shut down, and that's never a good thing.
We have locked some things down for security reasons, and the entire web server runs as an unprivileged user in an almost empty chroot jail, so even if you're looking around, there's not much you can get access to. Either way, we understand that people are that way inclined and hope that if you do choose to dig deep and you do find some things open that probably shouldn't be for a public service, feel free to shoot us an email and we'll fix it up and thank you graciously!

Security

The nature of a system like this means that your files or rendered code WILL be exposed to any person with a bit of PHP savvy, so this is your warning not to put any IP or sensitive information up here, and that if you do, we are not taking ANY responsibility as per the GPL license warranty.
It's also worth mentioning that code stored here will only stick around for a maximum of 30 days.
